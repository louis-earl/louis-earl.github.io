        <h2>From Pixel-Perfect UI to Integrating APIs</h2>
        <p>
          I work across both UX and front-end to turn ideas into real, working
          products—faster and with fewer handoff headaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          By speaking both “designer” and “developer,” I help teams avoid the
          usual lost-in-translation moments and keep things consistent from
          Figma to final build. The result? Less back-and-forth, more polish,
          and products that actually match the prototype.

        <h2>Design with Intent</h2>

        <p>
          I don't just make things pretty—I make them purposeful. From
          wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes, I design user experiences that
          are intuitive, inclusive, and built around real-world context. I ask
          “why” as often as I ask “how,” and I use design as a tool to solve
          problems, not just decorate them.
        </p>

        <h2>Front-End with Firepower</h2>
        <p>
          This is where I thrive. I build performant, accessible, and
          maintainable front-ends using modern frameworks like Angular. I write
          clean, component-based code, integrate complex APIs, and keep UI in
          sync with UX—even when the scope shifts. Whether I'm debugging a
          layout issue or untangling legacy spaghetti, I love turning chaos into
          clarity.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also big on developer experience: reusable design systems, tidy
          architecture, and code that's friendly for the next person (even if
          that person is future me at 11p.m.).
