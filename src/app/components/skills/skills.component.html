  My background blends front-end development, UX design, and just enough game
  programming to make things dangerously interactive. I thrive at the
  intersection of logic and creativity — where thoughtful interfaces meet clean,
  performant code. The result? Interfaces that don’t just work, but feel great
  to use.
