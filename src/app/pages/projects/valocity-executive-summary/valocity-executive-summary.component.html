  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I was tasked to completely redesign an important PDF report—used by lender
    managers who need to make quick, high-stakes decisions. The challenge was to
    turn a complex, cluttered document into a clear and concise summary. The new
    report had to get straight to the point.
  </p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    In India, when a lender requests a valuation for a high-risk property,
    multiple valuation firms are often engaged to assess the same property. Once
    all valuations are submitted, the Valocity platform compares the data and
    generates a report—the Executive Summary. This report is reviewed by
    high-level managers who need to make fast, informed decisions.
  </p>

  <h3>My Role</h3>
  <p>
    I was the designer for this project, with a focus on layout and information
    hierarchy. Our marketing team provided the visual standards for print, and I
    implemented them across the report. I also designed a new in-platform viewer
    so users could preview the report before downloading the PDF.

  <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
  <p>
    The old report was a monster—up to 24 pages long, with key insights buried
    under layers of scattered content. It was clear why managers struggled: the
    layout made it hard to scan, and the important stuff just didn't stand out.
  </p>
  <p>
    To guide the redesign, we gathered insights directly from users. We learned
    what managers really needed to know—fast:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Are the deviations (in values provided by different valuation firms)
      within an acceptable range?
    </li>
    <li>Can I trust the results from each valuation firm?</li>
    <li>Is it safe for me to approve a loan for this property?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Armed with this real user feedback, I focused on restructuring the report so
    these critical questions could be answered immediately, right from the first
    page.

  <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>

  <h3>Front Page Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The biggest design challenge was making the first page so comprehensive,
    that managers could make an informed decision without looking any further.
    It had to act like a dashboard—dense with useful information, but not
    visually overwhelming. I went through many low-fidelity iterations to find
    the right balance of density, clarity, and flow.
  </p>
  <h3>Reconsidering the Map</h3>
  <p>
    Some surprising feedback we had from the old design: lenders wanted the map
    on the front page. Why? Because lenders in India need to verify that valuers
    had <i>actually</i> visited the property—not just faked it from their desk.
    I ensured the map was a prominent feature, with pins that only need to stand
    out when something's not right.
  </p>
  <h3>Flag System</h3>
  <p>
    The platform already compared valuers' inputs and flagged discrepancies. I
    made the flag count prominent on the front page. No flags? All good. But if
    issues are flagged, the reader knows instantly to take a deeper look at the
    full report.
  </p>
  <h3>New Graph Layout</h3>
  <p>
    We knew the old graph didn't include enough data points to support confident
    decision-making, so the redesigned graph had to cram in more data without
    overwhelming the reader, or overlapping labels. Through multiple iterations
    driven by user feedback, I refined the layout to balance data density with
    clarity—ensuring outliers and patterns pop instantly.

  <h2>Final Result</h2>
  <p>
    I handed off the designs to our India-based dev team, who implemented the
    report using our PDF generation service. The new in-platform viewer also let
    users preview reports before downloading.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the final length varies depending on the job, the redesigned reports
    now average 10-12 pages—a huge reduction from the original 18-24. More
    importantly, managers can now make informed decisions faster, with
    everything they need front and center.
