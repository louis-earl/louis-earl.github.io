    <h2>In a galaxy, not so far away...</h2>
    <p>
      What started as a quirky game idea turned into one of the most challenging
      and rewarding projects I’ve ever worked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Way Wellington is a 2D spaceship building and management game, where
      players transport creative talent across the galaxy to New Zealand’s
      capital. The game was developed in collaboration with WellingtonNZ and
      presented at the Massey Exposure Exhibition in 2019.
    </p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
      I was the creator, designer, and developer of One Way Wellington. I built
      the gameplay systems, wrote the code, and directed the project’s creative
      vision. During production, I led a team of seven second-year students who
      contributed to UI design, character art, and 2D asset creation. I also
      coordinated with WellingtonNZ to ensure the game’s themes aligned with
      their creative outreach goals.

    <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>Build-Your-Own Spaceship</h3>
    <p>
      Using a flexible tile-based system, players lay out rooms, corridors, and
      airlocks — then equip the ship with essentials like fuel storage and
      oxygen tanks. Builder-bots handle construction in real time, reacting
      dynamically as the blueprint evolves.
    </p>

    <h3>Chart a Course Across the Galaxy</h3>
    <p>
      Use the star map to plan your journey, choosing which planets to visit
      along the way. Each stop brings new passengers eager to join your voyage —
      as long as you have enough fuel to get them safely to Wellington.
    </p>

    <h3>Pick Up Passengers (and Keep Them Alive)</h3>
    <p>
      They’re artists, dreamers... and kind of needy. At each station, you
      choose who boards your ship. Every passenger has needs — oxygen, food,
      rest, and the occasional bathroom break. Make sure your ship’s systems can
      handle the load, or risk seeing your mission fall apart mid-flight.

    <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
    <h3>A Technical Playground</h3>
    <p>
      I built One Way Wellington in Unity using C#, diving headfirst into
      gameplay logic, AI systems, and real-time simulation. Every system had to
      talk to each other in real time — from passengers breathing oxygen to
      builder-bots reacting to new room placements. What started as a fun game
      project quickly spiraled into a full-blown system design rabbit hole, and
      my curious brain loved every second of it.
    </p>
    <app-expansion-content title="The nerdy bits I couldn’t leave out">
      <h4>2D Tile-Based Building:</h4>
      <p>
        The entire game world was built on a tile grid. Every system — from AI
        to pathfinding to oxygen — relied on this. It was the foundation for
        everything.
      </p>
      <h4>Real-Time Oxygen Simulation:</h4>
      <p>
        I used a flood-fill algorithm to simulate oxygen flow between rooms. But
        here's the catch: it had to update in real time. Passengers consumed
        oxygen
        <i>every game tick</i>, so I had to optimize hard — recalculating only
        when something actually changed.
      </p>
      <h4>Builder Bots & Construction Queue:</h4>
      <p>
        Builder robots followed a live-updating construction queue, even as
        players placed new tiles. Keeping them coordinated without bugs was a
        huge challenge.
      </p>
      <h4>AI & Pathfinding:</h4>
      <p>
        Passengers constantly asked, “Where’s the closest bed?” They used the
        tile system to find destinations, then plotted a path through doors,
        rooms… even airlocks. And if an airlock opened? That triggered a reflow
        in the oxygen system. Everything was connected.
      </p>
      <h4>Save/Load System:</h4>
      <p>
        Saving meant capturing the entire game state — layout, passengers,
        construction, oxygen levels — and restoring it perfectly. No pressure.
      </p>
      <h4>Achievements & Event System:</h4>
      <p>
        I built an event system to track player progress, and give helpful
        nudges along the way.
      </p>

    <h3>Scope Creep Is Real</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge wasn’t technical — it was knowing when to stop. I
      had a million ideas and limited time. I learned hard (and sometimes
      painful) lessons about managing scope and prioritizing features.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I wouldn’t change a thing. By the end of the project, I walked away
      with real-world experience, hard-earned wisdom, and a toolkit of technical
      skills I use to this day.

    <h2>Where it Landed</h2>
    <p>
      <i>A playable demo, a public exhibition, and a proud developer.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final game was a playable, ambitious demo packed with technical
      systems I’d never built before — and I’m incredibly proud of what I
      accomplished. One Way Wellington was shown at
