    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <h3>What is Valocity Onsite?</h3>
    <p>
        Valocity Onsite is a mobile app that helps property valuers collect data during
        on-site inspections. It works hand-in-hand with Valocity Connect (our web platform), using the same form via a
        shared webview so everything stays consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
        This shiny new app replaced the previous mobile "solution"—a
        glorified PDF viewer that handled like a soggy clipboard and inspired about as much excitement as a tax audit.
    </p>

    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>
        To replace outdated workflows (pen, paper, and manual data re-entry)—and the clunky, underused legacy app—with a
        mobile-first solution that works offline, streamlines inspection flow, and speeds up submissions. The goal was
        to improve both usability and adoption by building a tool valuers would actually want to use in the field.
    </p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
        I led the UI/UX design of the app from the ground up. This was my first mobile UX project, and I was the
        company's first in-house designer on the job. I worked solo at first, then collaborated with a newly hired Lead
        UX Designer to refine the UI and implement our first-ever design system.

    <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>

    <h3>Where we started</h3>
    <p>
        The existing mobile app had near-zero adoption. Valuers found it clunky and slower than using paper. (Imagine an
        app so unintuitive, people preferred handwriting everything in 40-degree heat. That's the level we were dealing
        with.) The challenge? Build something that actually gets used in the field.
    </p>

    <h3>Research Approach</h3>
    <p>
        With no direct access to users (target audience was based in India), I got creative. I reverse-engineered the
        old app by simulating a property inspection in my own home, acting as a valuer.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Pain Points:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Form was a massive, unbroken scroll with hundreds of fields</li>
        <li>Errors were hard to locate on submission</li>
        <li>Field order didn’t match real-world workflow</li>
        <li>Important inputs hidden under expansion panels</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Designing a Better Experience</h2>

    <h3>Design Strategy</h3>

    <p>
        I broke the experience into clear, digestible parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Split the form into logical sections, that match the flow of a real-world inspection.</li>
        <li>Used a tabbed interface to keep the form manageable</li>
        <li>Added a progress indicator to show how much was left to complete</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools & Process</h3>
    <p>
        I used Figma end-to-end—from wireframes to interactive prototypes. Our product team demoed these prototypes to
        partner valuation firms and relayed feedback, which led to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The “map view” feature offering directions to the selected property</li>
        <li>A final confirmation step</li>
        <li>Reorganised form structure for speed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evolving with a Design System</h2>

    <h3>Company Shift</h3>
    <p>
        Mid-project, our new Lead UX Designer joined and built Valocity’s first design system. I worked closely with
        them to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update my screens with consistent typography, colours, spacing</li>
        <li>Improve accessibility and cohesion</li>
        <li>Migrate designs to reusable components</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Handoff & Implementation</h2>

    <h3>Design to Dev</h3>

    <p>
        I handed off the final designs to a dedicated development team and supported implementation as a designer. While
        I moved on to other front-end projects, I stayed available to answer questions and adapt the UI based on
        technical feedback.

    <h2>Outcome & Reflection</h2>

    <h3>Launch & Impact</h3>
    <p>
        Valocity Onsite launched successfully and showed improved adoption compared to the previous app. Stakeholders
        were enthusiastic—it was the company’s first true in-house design project, and it set the tone for future UX
        work.
    </p>

    <h3>What I’m Proud Of</h3>
    <p>
        Designing a full mobile app experience—solo—as a graduate developer. I proved my UX instincts and set the
        foundation for a new design culture at the company.
    </p>

    <h3>What I’d Do Differently</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Start with a design system from day one</li>
        <li>Advocate for direct user research, even if remote</li>
        <li>Collaborate with developers sooner to avoid rework</li>
    </ul>
