    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Valocity Connect is a platform that helps property valuers track their
      Valuation Jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team undertook a full redesign of the valuation forms, aiming to
      improve usability, navigation, and efficiency.

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      I led the front-end development and UX design for the valuation form
      overhaul, focusing on scalability, usability, and developer efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>My contributions included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Front-End Architecture:</strong>
        Designed a modular Angular form framework, allowing teams to build new
        valuation forms quickly without reimplementing common features.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Complete UX Redesign:</strong>
        Reimagined the valuation forms from the ground up, addressing pain
        points like poor navigation, overwhelming length, and
        difficult-to-locate validation errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Team Collaboration & Mentorship:</strong>
        Worked closely with our lead UX designer and backend team to align
        design decisions with technical feasibility, while mentoring a junior
        front-end developer on Angular and RxJS best practices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      Redesigning the valuation forms came with several key challenges. The
      system had to support highly flexible, complex forms while remaining
      intuitive for users. Valuers needed to complete forms quickly and
      efficiently, often in the field using mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve this, we had to tackle scalability, usability, and mobile
      responsiveness while ensuring the system remained easy to maintain and
      extend.
    </p>

        <h3>Plug-In Method for Forms</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to develop a system where different forms could "plug in"
          seamlessly to a wider form framework, requiring a highly flexible form
          architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was important because banks can initiate different
          <i>types</i> of jobs to their external partners. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Full Market Valuation:</strong> focused on a single
            property.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Project Site Inspection:</strong> for assessing an active
            construction project with multiple buildings or apartments
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Clearance</strong> for a bank's legal team to review
            all the documents related to a construction projects.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To add to the carnage, requirements differ greatly between markets
          such as India and UAE. Since new valuation types could be introduced
          in the future, the form system had to be both scalable and adaptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve this, we designed a modular, plug-in architecture, where
          each form type was built as an independent component. These components
          seamlessly integrated into a shared framework, which handled state
          management, validation, navigation, and API interactions. This allowed
          new forms to be added with minimal effort — without having to
          reimplement common features.

        <h3>Improving Form Usability and Error Handling</h3>
        <p>
          One of the biggest pain points in the old system was error visibility.
          Users struggled to find validation errors, often scrolling through
          hundreds of fields to locate a single mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this, we introduced step-based navigation with dynamic
          error indicators. Steps with validation errors were clearly
          highlighted, allowing users to jump directly to problem areas.
          Additionally, we implemented smart scrolling, so the form
          automatically adjusted to bring errors into view. These improvements
          significantly reduced user frustration and improved efficiency.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="segment-trigger">
        <h3>Mobile Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          Since valuers complete their inspections on-site, the challenge was to
          design a mobile interface that was more efficient than pen and paper —
          especially since these forms were also integrated into our mobile app,
          <a routerLink="../valocity-onsite">Valocity Onsite</a>. The forms
          needed to adapt seamlessly to all screen sizes, as valuers would later
          use desktops in the office to review and finalize the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve this, we prioritized mobile responsiveness alongside desktop
          needs during the design phase in Figma. The stepper collapsed into a
          banner on smaller screens, expanding into a menu for quick access to
          sections. Data tables were transformed into mobile-friendly cards to
          optimize vertical space, and each card featured an edit button that
          opened a mobile-optimized overlay for detailed interaction.

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
      While we didn't collect concrete metrics, the redesign significantly
      improved usability. Users now have a more structured, efficient experience
      when completing valuations.
