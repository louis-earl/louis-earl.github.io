    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Valocity Connect is a platform that helps property valuers track their Valuation Jobs.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Our team undertook a full redesign of the valuation forms, aiming to improve usability, navigation, and efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
        I led the front-end development and UX design for the valuation form overhaul, focusing on scalability, usability, and developer efficiency. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My contributions included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Front-End Architecture:</strong>
            Designed a modular Angular form framework, allowing teams to build new valuation forms quickly without reimplementing common features.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Complete UX Redesign:</strong>
            Reimagined the valuation forms from the ground up, addressing pain points like poor navigation, overwhelming length, and difficult-to-locate validation errors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Team Collaboration & Mentorship:</strong>
            Worked closely with our lead UX designer and backend team to align design decisions with technical feasibility, while mentoring a junior front-end developer on Angular and RxJS best practices.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        The biggest challenge was designing a flexible and scalable form framework that could cater to the diverse and complex requirements of various "Valuation Jobs." 
    </p>
    <p>
        This framework had to be adaptable yet user-friendly, with a seamless experience across both mobile and desktop environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobile Responsiveness:</h3>
    <p>
        As the forms were a core part of our mobile app, Valocity Onsite, they needed to work effortlessly during onsite visits, as valuers used mobile devices to complete inspections. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The stepper was designed to be mobile-first, appearing as a banner on smaller screens that expands into a menu, allowing for easy navigation on-the-go.
    </p>

    <h3>Plug-In Method for Forms:</h3>
    <p>
        The biggest technical hurdle was building a system where different forms could "plug in" seamlessly. After some trial and error, I collaborated with the team to structure components and services effectively. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I documented the process in a wiki guide and created a visual diagram for clarity, ensuring that new forms could be easily built using a modular system that required minimal setup.
    </p>

</div>

    <h3>State Management & API Integration:</h3>
    <p>
        Handling form data and integration with the back-end API was simplified by the event-driven architecture of the framework. Angular services managed the state and communication between components, ensuring seamless updates. The "Save" and "Submit" buttons triggered API actions, with proper synchronization to keep the form data consistent with the backend. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The architecture also allowed for easy customization of forms, enabling complex forms like "Site Inspections" or "Full Valuations" to be added with minimal configuration.
    </p>
    <p>        
        Additionally, I ensured proper handling of subscriptions to avoid potential memory leaks by scoping services to specific modules rather than app-wide and ensuring subscriptions were unsubscribed when components were destroyed.
    </p>

    <h2>UI/UX Enhancements</h2>
    <p>
        The previous forms were overwhelmingâ€”long, difficult to navigate, and frustrating when errors occurred. To fix this, I introduced a dynamic stepper:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Step-based navigation:</strong>
            Users could quickly jump between sections.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Error visibility:</strong>
            Steps with validation errors were highlighted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Smart scrolling:</strong>
            As users scrolled down the form, the stepper updated automatically.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="segment-trigger">
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
        While we didn't collect concrete metrics, the redesign significantly improved usability. Users now have a more structured, efficient experience when completing valuations.
    </p>
