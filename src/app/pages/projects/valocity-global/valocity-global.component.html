    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Valocity Connect is a platform that helps property valuers track and complete their
      Valuation Jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team undertook a full redesign of the valuation forms, aiming to
      improve usability, navigation, and efficiency.

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      I led the front-end development and UX design for the valuation form
      overhaul, focusing on scalability, usability, and developer efficiency.
    </p>
    <div class="image-slot"></div>
    <p>My contributions included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Complete UX Redesign:</strong>
        Reimagined the valuation forms from the ground up, addressing pain
        points like poor navigation, overwhelming length, and
        difficult-to-locate validation errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Front-End Architecture:</strong>
        Designed a modular Angular form framework, allowing teams to build new
        valuation forms quickly without reimplementing common features.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Team Collaboration & Mentorship:</strong>
        Worked closely with our lead UX designer and backend team to align
        design decisions with technical feasibility, while mentoring a junior
        front-end developer on Angular and RxJS best practices.

    </ul>

    <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      The existing forms were built for straightforward, single-property valuations. But our product was evolving to support a new “Site Inspection” valuation—for developments with multiple high-rise buildings, each containing hundreds of units. The old system already struggled with basic navigation and error validation, and it simply couldn’t handle the nested, repeatable data structures we needed.
    </p>
    <div class="image-slot"></div>
    <p>
      This was a chance for me to flex both sides of my brain: rethinking not just the interface, but how the system handled complexity under the hood. We needed a form experience that could support deeply nested data without overwhelming the user—keeping in mind that valuation data is collected out in the field on mobile devices, and then reviewed back in the office on desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      That meant designing for scalability, mobile responsiveness, and real-world usability—all while keeping the system maintainable and easy to extend in the long term.

        <h3>Plug-In Method for Forms</h3>
        <p>
          I built a flexible form architecture that allowed different valuation types to "plug in"
          to a wider form framework—critical for supporting a wide range of job types across international markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Banks could initiate vastly different workflows, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Full Market Valuations</strong> for single
            properties.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Site Inspections</strong> for multi-building construction projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Clearances</strong> for document reviews for an entire development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each form type came with unique requirements, and these varied even further between markets like India and the UAE. We needed a scalable system that could evolve as new job types were introduced.
        </p>
        <div class="image-slot"></div>
        <p>
          The solution was a modular plug-in architecture: each form type was developed as an independent component, then integrated into a central framework that handled shared functionality—state management, validation, navigation, and API interactions. This made it easy to add new forms without duplicating logic or reinventing the wheel.

        <h3>Improving Form Usability and Error Handling</h3>
        <p>
          One of the biggest pain points in the old system was error visibility.
          Users struggled to find validation errors, often scrolling through
          hundreds of fields to locate a single mistake.
        </p>
        <div class="image-slot"></div>
        <p>
          To address this, we introduced step-based navigation with dynamic
          error indicators. Steps with validation errors were clearly
          highlighted, allowing users to jump directly to problem areas.
          Additionally, we implemented smart scrolling, so the form
          automatically adjusted to bring errors into view. These improvements
          significantly reduced user frustration and improved efficiency.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>Mobile Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
          Since valuers complete their inspections on-site, the challenge was to
          design a mobile interface that was more efficient than pen and paper —
          especially since these forms were also integrated into our mobile app,
          <a routerLink="../valocity-onsite">Valocity Onsite</a>. The forms
          needed to adapt seamlessly to all screen sizes, as valuers would later
          use desktops in the office to review and finalize the data.
        </p>
        <div class="image-slot"></div>
        <p>
          To solve this, we prioritized mobile responsiveness alongside desktop
          needs during the design phase in Figma. The stepper collapsed into a
          banner on smaller screens, expanding into a menu for quick access to
          sections. Data tables were transformed into mobile-friendly cards to
          optimize vertical space, and each card featured an edit button that
          opened a mobile-optimized overlay for detailed interaction.

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Since launch, more than 1,000 development projects have been registered in the system—each requiring regular inspections throughout the construction lifecycle. The redesigned forms make these complex site visits faster and more seamless for valuers in the field, while giving banks a quicker, clearer path to approve loans for under-construction properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system now supports multiple valuation types, including Full Market Valuations in both India and the UAE, all built on a flexible, scalable architecture. Today, these forms are live inside the Valocity Onsite mobile app via a webview, helping users around the world complete valuations with confidence—whether they're inspecting a single home or a massive high-rise project.
