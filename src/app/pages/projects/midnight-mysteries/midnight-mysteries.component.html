    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>
      Midnight Mysteries was developed by an eight-person team within one week.
      This was our final project while studying at Dev Academy Aotearoa, and the
      completed product was presented at our graduation.
    </p>

    <h3>The Game</h3>
    <p>
      Midnight Mysteries is a battle of deception for four or more players.
      Avoid elimination each round while taking out the opposition to win this
      game!
    </p>

    <h3>How to play</h3>
    <p>
      The game is played by two teams: the Mafia and the Innocent. The objective
      of the game is for the Mafia to â€œeliminate" the Innocent until they are
      the majority, or for the Innocent to collectively vote off the entire
      Mafia.

    <h2>My Involvement</h2>

    <p>
      As the Product Owner of Midnight Mysteries, I was responsible for the
      overall vision and direction of the project - to ensure the whole team was
      working on the same page.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role evolved into a Team Lead position during development, where I
      regularly checked in across the team to establish and assist with any
      blocks or needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I maintained the team Kanban Board between daily sprints. This involved
      breaking up big tasks into a series of smaller 'cards'. Team members could
      then self-allocate tasks using the cards, which prevented overlapping work
      and minimised Git merge conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the team was well organised to follow an agile workflow, I could
      also spend time doing what I love, programming for games. With my previous
      programming experience, I was able to offer technical assistance to the
      team.
